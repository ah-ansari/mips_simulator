# mips_simulator
A simple simulator for MIPS CPU architecture.

In this project, a basic simulator for a restricted set of actions for the MIPS CPU architecture is implemented in the C language. It is tried to implement the project as realistic and as close to MIPS architecture as possible.

The simulator works in this way that the file "instructions.txt" should be initialized with the opcodes of the instructions, and other types of memory like data memory and registers can be initialized through the files like "dataMemory.txt" and "regFile.txt". Then the file "main.c" should be executed.

This was the project of the course "Computer Architecture".
